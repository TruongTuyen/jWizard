.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading: b buttons
  .panel-body
    :markdown
      Each key of the buttons hash represents one of the 4 generated
      buttons. These objects are passed directly to jQuery, giving you
      a lot of control over the resulting HTML by simply changing the
      properties of the default configuration object. (setting an entire
      button object here as `false` or `null` will cause that button to
      not be rendered at all)

      The `icons` parameter is an exception, that value is extracted
      before generating the button HTML and is handed off to the jQuery
      UI Button Widget initialization.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b buttons.cancel
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          The cancel button is generated as a reset button, with an the
          `ui-priority-secondary` class for de-emphasis. It is also
          aligned furthest to the left.
        pre
          | {
          |   "class": "ui-priority-secondary",
          |   text: "Cancel",
          |   type: "reset",
          |   icons: {
          |     primary: "ui-icon-circle-close"
          |   }
          | }

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b buttons.prev
      .panel-body
        p
          | The previous button is generated as a standard button, it is
          | aligned to the left (but right of the cancel button)
        pre
          | {
          |   text: "Previous",
          |   type: "button",
          |   icons: {
          |     primary: "ui-icon-circle-triangle-w"
          |   }
          | }

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b buttons.next
      .panel-body
        p
          | The next button is generated as a standard button, it is aligned
          | to the right.
        pre
          | {
          |   text: "Next",
          |   type: "button",
          |   icons: {
          |     primary: "ui-icon-circle-triangle-e"
          |   }
          | }

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b buttons.finish
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          The finish button is generated as a submit button, with both
          `ui-priority-primary` and `ui-state-highlight` classes for maximum
          emphasis. It is also aligned to the right.
        pre.pull-lift
          | {
          |   "class": "ui-priority-primary ui-state-highlight",
          |   text: "Finish",
          |   type: "submit",
          |   icons: {
          |     secondary: "ui-icon-circle-check"
          |   }
          | }

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading: b progress
  .panel-body
    :markdown
      These options configure the [extended progressbar](#progressbar).
      (formerly known as the counter)

      By setting this value to `false` or `null`, the progressbar will be
      ignored altogether.

.panel.panel-default
  .panel-heading: b effects
  .panel-body
    p
      | These options configure various transitions and effects used by
      | jWizard. As of this writing, (v2.0) the only transitions applied
      | are to the show and hide of steps. See the jQuery UI documentation
      | for complete documentation on the available options.
    pre
      | effects: {
      |   steps: {
      |     hide: {
      |       effect:    "blind",
      |       direction: "left",
      |       duration:  250
      |     },
      |     show: {
      |       effect:    "blind",
      |       direction: "left",
