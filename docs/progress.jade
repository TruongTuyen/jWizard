  h2 Extended Progressbar

.row
  .col-md-4.text-justify
    :markdown
      As of `v2.0`, jWizard comes bundled with a widget that extends the
      [jQuery UI Progressbar Widget](http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/) widget.
      This extension unobtrusively adds a new feature, a label reflecting the
      value (in relation to max) that is positioned over the progressbar itself.
      This feature is "opt-in" only. (by setting the `label` option)

      That being said, if you have included jWizard, you have access to the enhanced
      progressbar without any additional work on your part. The eventual goal is to
      submit this feature to the jQuery UI team for inclusion.

    b Configuration Options:
    .alert.alert-info
      :markdown
        These options are in addition to the documented options of the
        [jQuery UI Progressbar Widget](http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/)

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading
        != "<b>label</b> <code>String</code> (Default: <code>null</code>)"
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          This option has 2 possible values, each adds a label to the progressbar:

           - `"count"` adds a label that is formatted as `"55 of 100"`
           - `"percentage"` adds a label that is formatted as `"55%"`

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading
        != "<b>append</b> <code>String</code> (Default: <code>null</code>)"
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          This option specifies a "suffix" for the label, and appends the specified
          string to the generated label text.

          For example, jWizard appends "Complete" by default so the label would appear
          as `"3 of 5 Complete"`.
