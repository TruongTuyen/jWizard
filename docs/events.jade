    h3 Wizard Events
    :markdown
      These events are triggered on the root element for the wizard itself.
      As such, they can be bound to as part of the configuration options of
      the wizard widget.

      The internal `widgetEventPrefix` is set as `wizard` (not `jWizard`) so
      remember that when binding to the `cancel` and `finish` events after
      the initialization.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b
        span.text-muted wizard
        | cancel
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          Triggered when the user clicks the cancel button. If the button is also
          acting as a reset button (which is the default behavior) you can return
          `false` here to cancel the form reset. (or simply change the button type
          in the config)

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b
        span.text-muted wizard
        | finish
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          Triggered when the user clicks the finish button. If the button is also
          acting as a submit button (which is the default behavior) you can return
          `false` here to cancel the form submission.

    h3 Step Events
    :markdown
      These events are triggered on the step elements **directly**, and while
      they will bubble up to the wizard widget, the typical pattern is to bind
      directly to the step elements.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b
        span.text-muted step
        | hide
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          Triggered before a step is hidden. (which occurs when transitioning from
          one step to another) By cancelling this event, the transition will not
          be completed, leaving this step active.

          This event is expected to be used to validate form inputs, and to cancel
          the event when invalid data is found.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b
        span.text-muted step
        | hidden
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          Triggered after a step has been hidden, and before the next step is to
          be shown. It _cannot_ be cancelled.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b
        span.text-muted step
        | show
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          Triggered before a step is to be shown, and after the previous step has
          been hidden. Cancelling this event will revert the wizard back to the
          previous step.

          This event is expected to be used to initialize the interface for the
          upcoming step.

    .panel.panel-default
      .panel-heading: b
        span.text-muted step
        | shown
      .panel-body
        :markdown
          Triggered after a step has been shown. It _cannot_ be cancelled.

          This event is expected to be used to refresh/reposition interface
          elements that may not be able to be positioned correctly when the
          elements are still hidden in the DOM.
