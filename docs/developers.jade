  For anyone who wants to hack on jWizard (would be much appreciated) with me,
  you should be able to get started pretty easily.

  ### Dependencies

  Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), (v0.8+) then install the dependencies:

      npm install

  ### Running Tests

  You'll need an internet connection to run the tests, this is because the
  jQuery and jQuery UI scripts are loaded via the Google CDN dynamically. In
  addition, the version of each of those dependencies can be changed on the fly
  as well to run the suite against various version combinations.

      make test

  To run tests against a specific version combination of jQuery and jQuery UI,
  which can be specified via the command line:

      make test JQUERY=1.8.3 JQUERYUI=1.8.24

  will run the test suite against **jQuery 1.8.3** and **jQuery UI 1.8.24**.

  Submit your patches as Github Pull Requests. Please modify the tests to reflect
  your changes, and make sure they all pass before submitting your PR. Also,
  there is no formal style guide, just follow the conventions that are in place.
